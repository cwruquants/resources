### What is version control?

Version control is a system that helps track changes to files over time. 
It allows multiple people to work on a project without overwriting each other's work and keeps a history of all changes. 
This makes it easy to go back to an earlier version if something goes wrong. Version control is especially useful for software development, but itâ€™s also helpful for writing, design, 
and other projects where files change often.

### What tools do you use for version control?

The most common form of version control is GitHub (you may have heard of this before). GitHub is sort of the industry standard, but some companies do use alternatives like BitBucket as well.
